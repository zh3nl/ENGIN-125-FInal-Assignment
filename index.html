          Artificial Intelligence, otherwise known as AI, is technologies that
          enable computers to simulate human learning, problem solving, and
          creativity. As defined by Stryker et al. in their article for IBM,
          Applications equipped with AI can performed many daily tasks such as
          answering basic questions, making recommendations to users, and
          generate different products such as articles, images, and even
          full-stack websites [1]. The most popular model, which include the
          infamous ChatGPT, can even create complex and original content in
          response to a user's prompt.

        <header>How is AI created?</header>
        <p>
          In general, generative AI can be simplified into
          <strong>three</strong> key phases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Training: </strong>Creating a foundational model that
            represents the data it was trained on. The most popular foundation
            models today are Large Language Models (LLMs)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tuning: </strong>Adapting the model to a specific
            application, either through fine tuning with situation-specific data
            and prompts or through Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
            (RLHF), where humans evaluate the accuracy of model outputs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Generation and Evaluation: </strong>Applications with
            generative AI is regularly assessed and tuned to create more
            relevant responses. Retrieval Augemented Generation is also used to
            extend the foundational model to out-of-scope data that are deemed
            relevant for training
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <header>Use Cases and Ethical Dilemmas</header>
        <p>
          With AI becoming more efficient and more accurate, it offers versatile
          benefits across various industries:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Software Engineering: </strong>Provide code snippet
            suggests, debug code errors, and create small-scale applications
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Science: </strong>Automate data collection,
            preprocessing, and generate basic analysis
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business: </strong>Automate customer service (chatbots),
            provide manufacturing management, and assist with job recruitment
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthcase: </strong>Automate telemedicine and provide basic
            diagnosis
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Education: </strong>Generate lecture materials for teachers
            and study materials for students
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because of its immense potential in automation and scaling, many
          companies and organizations are scrambling to capitalize on the latest
          AI technologies. As a result, it is important to address and adapt to
          the many risks and ethical dilemmas posed by the use of AI as it
          becomes increasingly influential in our lives. Because of its novel
          status, many applications of AI remains in the gray area of legal and
          ethical standards, making it very difficult to assess its impact to
          humanity. While AI can significantly improve the human workflow, it
          also comes with several concerns, particularly in the following
          issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Potential data breaches that violate individual privacy</li>
          <li>
            The presence of bias within Large Language Models, particularly
            against traditionally underrepresented minority groups
          </li>
          <li>
            The replacement of human decision-making with AI, even though
            mainstream LLM research ignores the psychological diversity of
            people around the world
          </li>
          <li>
            The lack of transparency between organizations and the public
            regarding AI development and use
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Case_studies">
        <header>Case Studies</header>
        <p>
          Here, we will investigate generative AI and its impact on the creative
          sector with the following case study from Santa Clara University:
        </p>
        <strong>Background</strong>
        <p>
          Even though generative AI have been around since the 1950s, a major
          step forward was taken by OpenAI, who scaled generative AI models
          using the Internet and created the GPT text models we know today.
          Along with ChatGPT, OpenAI also created DALL-E, which generated
          original artworks based on user prompts. With this, the AI craze began
          and companies rushed to create products such as Stability AI and
          LensaAI. Soon, it is apparent that generative AI is the "next greatest
          thing" as it made its mark in the world. As stated by Ackerman, with
          generative AI becoming more dominant in text, image, and content
          generation, there have been concerns about the impact of generative AI
          on human creativity. In fact, many of these companies like Stability
          AI was sued for using the images of different artists without their
          permission [2]. Similar issues were faced in the music industry, where
          AI-generated music often use the voice and instrumentals of existing
          artists and producers.
        </p>
        <strong>Ethical Dilemmas: </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Generative AI allows people to easily copy art styles, making it
            difficult to distinguish between what is truly original content
          </li>
          <li>
            With the influx of AI-generated content on the Internet, we might
            foresee a future where machines monopolizes creativity
          </li>
          <li>
            If the image is generated by AI, can it really be considered
            creative?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With these dilemmas in mind, I would like you to consider the
          following reflection questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How can we use generative AI to elevate human creavitity, rather
            than imitate it?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you think content created by AI should be considered art? What
            about the users behind them, are they artists? What really defines
            original and creative content?
          </li>
          <li>
            Should copyright and intellectual property laws apply to content
            created by generative AI?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As society draws closer to a future where AI becomes a part of our
          daily lives, it is important to find ethical and sustainable ways in
          which humans use AI as tools to scale our work efficiency.

          No matter the industry or occupation, you have probably used AI at
          some point in your life. Discuss with a person you frequently work
          with (classmate, colleague, etc.) and think about different ways you
          can promote ethical and sustainable use of AI in your career.
